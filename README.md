# Exp - 3 Railway SYSTEM

# AIM:
To study the problem statement, SRS document and draw all the UML diagrams of Railway Management System.


# SRS (Procedure):
Preparation Phase:
Identify stakeholders such as passengers, railway staff, and administrators. Define the system’s scope — modules like ticket booking, scheduling, train tracking, and maintenance.

Requirements Elicitation:
Gather information through interviews, observations, surveys, and document analysis. Develop use cases (e.g., ticket booking, cancellation, train dispatch) to capture user needs.

Structuring the SRS Document:
The SRS typically includes:

Introduction: Purpose, scope, and references.

Overall Description: System overview, user types, and constraints.

Functional Requirements: Detailed list of system features such as ticket booking, route management, and fare calculation.

Non-Functional Requirements: Performance, reliability, security, and scalability criteria.

Interface Requirements: Details of user interfaces, hardware, and communication systems.

Data Requirements: Database structure, entities, and relationships.

Use Cases and Diagrams: Describe user interactions and system behavior.

Traceability Matrix: Links each requirement to its design and testing elements.

Review and Validation:
The document is reviewed by technical teams and stakeholders for completeness and accuracy, ensuring each requirement is testable and achievable.

Maintenance:
The SRS is updated as changes occur during development, keeping traceability between requirements and system components.
